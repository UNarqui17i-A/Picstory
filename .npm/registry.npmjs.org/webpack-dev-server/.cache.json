Server</h1>\n</div>\n\nUse [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) under the hood, which provides fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your `webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nThis will start a server, listening on connections from `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nNow, when you change something in your assets, it should live-reload the files.\n\nSee [**the documentation**](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver) for more use cases and options.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\nWe appreciate all help! Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to help.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img
