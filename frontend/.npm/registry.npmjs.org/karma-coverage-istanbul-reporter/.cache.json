istanbul 1.x APIs (with full sourcemap support) to report coverage.\n\n## About\nThis is a reporter only and does not perform the actual instrumentation of your code. Webpack users should use the [istanbul-instrumenter-loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader) and then use this karma reporter to do the actual reporting. See the [test config](https://github.com/mattlewis92/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter/blob/master/test/karma.conf.js) for an e2e example of how to combine them.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```js\n// karma.conf.js\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = function (config) {\n\n  config.set({\n\n    // ... rest of karma config\n\n    // anything named karma-* is normally auto included so you probably dont need this\n    plugins: ['karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter'],\n\n    reporters: ['coverage-istanbul'],\n\n    // any of these options are valid: https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbul-api/blob/47b7803fbf7ca2fb4e4a15f3813a8884891ba272/lib/config.js#L33-L38\n    coverageIstanbulReporter: {\n\n       // reports can be any that are listed here: https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbul-reports/tree/590e6b0089f67b723a1fdf57bc7ccc080ff189d7/lib\n      reports: ['html', 'lcovonly', 'text-summary'],\n\n       // base output directory.
