expand-braces [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/expand-braces.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/expand-braces)\n\n> Wrapper for [braces] to enable brace expansion for arrays of patterns.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n```sh\n$ npm i expand-braces --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar expand = require('expand-braces');\n```\n\nPass an array or list of strings:\n\n```js\nexpand('{foo,bar}', '{baz,quux}');\n// or\nexpand(['{foo,bar}', '{baz,quux}']);\n// both yield => [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'quux' ];\n```\n\nPass a function as the last argument to customize output:\n\n```js\nexpand(['{a..e}', '{f..h}'], function (str) {\n  return '_' + str;\n});\n\n//=> ['_a', '_b', '_c', '_d', '_e', '_f', '_g', '_h']\n```\n\n## Related projects\n\n*
