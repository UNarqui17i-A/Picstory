It's not\nclear what the best merged list is, but it's probably either `[2, 1, 3]` or\n`[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nIn general, it's not totally clear what the \"best\" merged list is, but there are\nsome basic properties that anyone would expect:\n\n- Since the order of list1 is preserved, the merged list will look like the\n  first list with the elements exclusive to the second inserted in betweeen\n- If `list2[i]` is not in `list1`, and it is possible to insert `list2[i]` into\n  `list1` without contradicting the order of `list2`, then it should be inserted\n  in such a way\n\nThis tool is very slow, crossing the 100ms mark with lists around 150 in length,\nand growing at a rate of\n`O(list2.length*list2.length*(list1.length + list2.length))` from there.\n\n\nInstallation / Usage\n--------------------\n\nInstall with\n\n```\nnpm install combine-lists\n```\n\nUse like so:\n\n```js\nvar combineLists = require('combine-lists');\ncombineLists([1, 2], [2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sjelin","email":"sjelin@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-09-07T14:18:12.607Z","created":"2016-02-19T22:56:13.275Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-19T22:56:13.275Z","1.0.1":"2016-09-07T14:18:12.607Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists#readme","keywords":["utility","array","list","merge","combine","topological","sort"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists.git"},"author":{"name":"sjelin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"57d021a4-1362\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 07 Sep 2016 14:18:12 GMT"}
